# PA Game Night Frontend

This project is hosted at https://blooming-coast-46890.herokuapp.com/.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to help assign users to games during an event to maximize the number of users who can play their preferred games. Participants are able to login with their name as a new or existing user and select up to three games (ranked) that they prefer to play. The participants can view which games people are most interested in through real-time updates and get an overview of which users selected which games. The organizers have the ability to remove users, remove users from games, and add games. In addition, they can also press the Match Users button to optimally match users to games to maximize the number of players and the preferences of the games.

The initial frontend code was written by Kevin Zhang, Jean Zhang, and Cristina Rong here: https://github.com/christinarong/pa-game-night. Andrew McCann and I built upon the original code to add more features.
